I wrote a blog post on [Unsupervised Environment Design](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/blog/unsupervised-environment-design/). The post acts as a general intro to UED, discusses how and when it can be useful, and when sister approaches like [Data Regularised Environment Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03479) are more appropriate (e.g. when you care more about zero-shot transfer than open-endedness).
