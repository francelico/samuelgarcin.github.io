My PhD research explores the relationships between deep reinforcement learning models and the mechanisms that generate their training data, under the guidance of [David Abel](https://david-abel.github.io/) and [Chris Lucas](https://lucaslab-uoe.github.io/members/chris/).

Before starting my PhD, I studied Aeronautics at Imperial College London, where I co-founded and led the [Imperial College Aerial Vehicle project](https://icavproject.wordpress.com). Following this, I spent three years in the robotics industry, working across various [robotic](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9143181) [and](https://www.thetimes.com/article/armed-drone-is-a-real-street-fighter-5j0vvk3vx) [autonomous](https://thebusinessmagazine.co.uk/companies/the-small-robot-company-to-transform-agriculture/) [vehicle](https://github.com/uoe-agents/IGP2) [projects](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9636279). Currently, I am  completing a research internship at Microsoft Research Beijing, mentored by [Kaixin Wang](https://kaixin96.github.io/).

My recent work focuses on harnessing generative models to enhance RL agent training. This can be done by having these models [control the environment instantiation process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03479) and shape the agent's training distribution. At Microsoft, I am investigating the training of RL agents within "world models", generative models that act as neural simulators of the environment. Complementing this research, our [recent study](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tErHYBGlWc) on information specialisation in actor-critic models brings into focus particular interactions that only occur in learning systems that influence their own training distribution. I find this aspect of online RL to be fascinating and a source of inspiration for my future research.

I am _always_ interested in collaboration opportunities! I co-organise UoE's virtual [Reinforcement Learning Reading Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/reading-group/), do reach out if you would like to come present your work.
